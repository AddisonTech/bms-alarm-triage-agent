# CHANGELOG

Per Rule 7 of `docs/40-10-Build_Standards.txt`: one entry per phase, one
line per Build Guide item, so a reader can compare what was built against
what the Build Guide says was decided.

**This file starts partway through the project.** The Build Standards
were not supplied to the phase build sessions, so Phases 0 through 5
produced no changelog at the time. Reconstructing them now would be a
record written after the fact and dressed as one kept during the work,
which is worse than admitting the gap. `docs/BUILD_STANDARDS_GAP.md`
item 1 covers what is missing and what reconstructing it would cost.
Entries below this line were written as the work happened.

## 2026-09-08 - P4-C1 revision, structured output on N8

P4-C1 - extended existing P4-C1 implementation: the forbidden-verb regex
is now a backstop behind a Pydantic response schema; the model returns
`reason`, `verb`, `target`, `detail`, and a reply that does not validate
fails exactly as a banned verb did before.

Why the change, stated because the Build Guide names the old mechanism
("Enforced by a forbidden-verb check on N8 output") and that sentence is
now only half true:

- The forbidden-verb list is a denylist of 25 words, so anything absent
  from it passes. Measured against the live gate, it permitted "force the
  discharge air sensor to 55 degrees", "bypass the low limit safety",
  "jumper out the freezestat", "replace the actuator", and "energize the
  compressor circuit". All five are control actions. None was blocked.
- The verb is now an enumerated field with seven permitted diagnostic
  actions, so a control action cannot occupy the verb slot at all.
- The action target must be the condition's own point path or equipment
  tag, which removes invented equipment from recommendations.
- A thermal-domain guard rejects prose calling a cooling condition a
  heating system or the reverse, derived from the point path and
  equipment tag the export already carries rather than from an
  equipment-type table.

What it does not do, recorded so the check is not trusted for more than
it does: prose can still misname what a point measures while staying in
the right thermal domain. A duct static pressure setpoint described as
"chilled water supply pressure" passes every check. That case is pinned
as an expected pass in `tests/test_schema.py` so a future reader does not
mistake the gap for coverage.

P2-C3 - extended existing P2-C3 implementation: the retry now appends the
validation failure to the prompt. The model is served at temperature
zero, so the previous retry re-sent an identical prompt and got identical
tokens back; `max_attempts` of 2 meant one attempt in practice.

Dependency note per Rule 10: Pydantic is on the pre-approved PROJECT
STANDARD STACK and was already present as a transitive dependency of
LangGraph. No new package was added and `pyproject.toml` is unchanged.

Corpus note: `data/fixtures/phase0/recorded_model_response.json` and its
manifest were regenerated, because a recorded response has to match the
contract it is a recording of. Regeneration changed those two files and
nothing else. No alarm export, trend export, or ground-truth file moved.

Verification, run by the student:

    .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
    .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m tools.evaluate.benchmark --split all
    .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m tools.demo --split holdout --model ollama

P4-C1 - implemented, VERIFIED: 378 tests pass. All three splits score
identically to the run before this change -- fixture 182 events / 36.4x,
dev 764 / 31.8x, holdout 548 events / 18 items / 30.4x / 100.0% recall /
0.0% false escalation. Verified live against
`llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M` as well as against the recorded response:
all 15 holdout escalations validated on the first attempt.

### Open item, not yet decided

The retained denylist rejects the bare noun "setpoint", which makes the
one point in the corpus that *is* a setpoint (`SYN1/AHU-21/CLG_SP`)
impossible to describe correctly. It is currently latent: the live model
happened to phrase around it. Removing "trend" from the allowed verbs
changed the phrasing enough to trigger it, and that condition dropped to
unresolved -- pooled recall moved from 100.0% to 93.3%. The change was
reverted rather than absorbed. Every genuine way to change a setpoint is
already caught by a verb on the list ("raise", "set", "adjust", "change"),
so the noun appears to carry no safety weight of its own. Awaiting a
decision before `config/triage.json` is touched.

## Out-of-guide tooling

Recorded because Rules 1 and 2 expect work to trace to a Student
Decision, and this does not.

`tools/demo.py` - added for a seminar recording. It runs the existing
graph and reuses the existing scoring; it computes nothing of its own and
is outside the packaged wheel. No Build Guide cluster authorises it.
